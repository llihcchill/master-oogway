'*If she leaves you for another, there is always their mother,*' we all need advice like that and so here is a discord bot that gives advice in Master Oogway's voice.

# Overview:
Discord bot that gives advice using machine learning and the discord.py library. This is going to be my first machine learning project ever so hopefully this thing works and I don't upset literally every machine learning engineer/data scientist with my documentation :)

# How the machine learning algorithm works:
## *Note: Before the algorithm is used the question in question (hehe) gets separated into its nouns and its verbs to be put into the algorithm, and also if possible, get only the quotes that contain most to all of the nouns and verbs or something along those lines.*
The machine learning algorithm in question is called the *whatever it turns out to be* algorithm.
The inputs to the algorithm consist of two nodes, of which one takes in the nouns and the other takes in the verbs:
```
code that is yet to be written
```
The next layer of nodes goes to understand how the nouns and verbs are connected, and so each node is responsible for each verb and noun combination which equates to about ~(however many combinations there actually are) nodes.
```
more code that is yet to be written
```
After the combinations are made, the algorithm should now have an understanding of what it's trying to answer, and so it will compare it's combinations to the quotes from the api that contain the verbs and maybe some of the nouns in the question.
```
even more code that is yet to be written
```
At this point, it can either pick one of these quotes to post in the discord server, or it can make its own using a bunch more algorithms and stuff which I will see if that is possible when it's up to that pace.
